              <h3> Who am I 🤔</h3>
               <p> I am Jules, the most dedicate guy in the world thanks to my 10-years-experience as a basketball team. I am driven by social interactions with my friends and hard-work 📚. I have a team spirit which boosts the confidence of my team members. Cycling 🚵‍♂️ is also special to me, you have to keep cycling otherwise you are falling down the mountain </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="cinema">
               <h3> Cinema 🎬 </h3>
               <p> I have always been fascinated by other cultures and way of life in general. With cinema, I can aknowledge some skills while learning and entertaining. I believe it will be a huge advantage in my future. From Christopher Nolan, to Villeneuve or even Nicolas Bedos, I love being in front of a huge screen. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-white" id="Sport">
               <h3>Sport is a big chapter of my life</h3>
               <p>To strike my balance, I have to practice sport at least 3 times a week. It keep my calm, relax and alos focused on my classes. It boosts my resilience and dedication to projects. I have been practicing :   </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <em> Ski </em> in competition for 5 years </li>
                     <li> <em> Basketball</em> since more than 10 years </li>
                     <li> <em> Workout</em> Since I am in Lille </li>
                  </ul>
               <p> Workout is great to expand my mind and always going further. It's a mind-blowing experience each team you workout. You surprise yourself</p>
               </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box-white" id="basketball">
               <h3> Basketball 🏀</h3>
               <p>Ever since I experienced this sport, I know it's my passion. Without a team you can't play, but if the team is not convinced it can win then it won't. it's the rule of life in a way. My favorite team is the <strong>NY Knicks</strong> because of their way of playing which I found very elegant.</p>
